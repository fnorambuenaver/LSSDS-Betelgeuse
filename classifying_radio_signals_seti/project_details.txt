Hello everyone, welcome to Classifying Radio Signals from Space using Keras in 
Python. In this article, you will learn about how to classify radio signal using 
CNN, how to display results and plot 2D spectrograms with Python in Jupyter 
Notebook.

Here, we will be using the dataset which is provided by the SETI Institute. The 
dataset is already normalized and divided into two directories i.e. testing and 
validation dataset. You can download the dataset from here with your Google account

Classify Radio Signals from Space with Keras

    In this project, you will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as 
its backend and use it to solve an image classification problem. The data 
consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen 
Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. The spectrograms will be treated as 
images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one 
of four classes. By the end of the project, you will have built and trained a 
convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras to classify signals from 
space.

The model could be optimized using hyperparameter tuning. However, the goal of 
this notebook is not to build a high performing classifier, rather to show the 
basic steps to build an image classifier using convolutional neural network. The 
readers can also get the idea of

*    data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator, and 
* Way of saving the weights of 
a model at some interval which can later be used for transfer learning through 
'callbacks' during fitting the model
